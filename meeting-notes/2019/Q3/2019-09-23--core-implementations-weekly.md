#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- ipget release shipped with a new progress bar and a new mode that force-spawns a temporary node
- go-ipfs patch release did not ship.
- RC5 on js-ipfs 0.38
  - community testing slim - but currently in that phase of the release process
  - aim for doing this tomorrow or beginning of next week

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

- a new challenger has appeared: david!

@achingbrain

- no updates

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- lidel at web browsers meetup


#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold while the libp2p async refactor finishes up


#### IPNS (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

- Adin out for ACM ICN conference

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

#### Package Managers Updates
@dirkmc / @adin / @djdv

(see below)

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc / @stebalien

- new bitswap proposal for block order:

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@alanshaw

- js-libp2p
  - Updates to several of the core refactor modules to add some needed items for the dialer flow
  - multistream-select PR from it-multistream-select is open [js-multistream-select#52](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multistream-select/pull/52), working through a bug with the dialer upgrade logic
  - Starting refactors on the other libp2p transports
- js-ipfs
  - fixing interop tests for async await
  - updating js-ipfs itself - in dependency hell

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- We had a design review for unixfsv1.5
  - Settled on putting metadata in the directory itself.
  - @stebalien is the DRI for writing this up.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- Dirk - review your js-bitswap PR

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

(molly) What are the initiatives we should have on this list for next quarter (Q4)? 
- aim to complete async await refactor this quarter
- Alex owning js-ipfs side of unixfsv1.5, and maybe Dominic on the go0-ipfs side
- js-libp2p - putting all time into async await refactor for next few weeks at least

### Parking Lot

- None

    - Update `ipfsd-ctl` to its latest version - ‚úÖ
    - Update tests to use `daemon.js` file and make sure they are still green - [WIP](https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/86)
