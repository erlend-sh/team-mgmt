## Notes


### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- @stebalien is going to run a go-ipfs release for 0.4.23 to fix build issues on go 1.13
- @achingbrain
  - ran RC tests on third party repos, found a bug
  - fixed it, found another bug
  - opened issues on third party repos inviting them to join the early-release programme
  - automation, automation, automation
    - Added interop tests to the build to run on every PR
    - Next: run against internal repos, and automate opening PRs to 3rd party repos

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw

- Jim - I did a "mapping" exercise to try to identify 10 starter tests to concentrate on in the next month. More feedback greatly appreciated! https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/33#issuecomment-531520092
- Raul is doing lots of work on the "testground" engine https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/37
  - will be used for things like testing the DHT
  - Jim will be doing some traffic shaping work on this
  - Aiming to land tests in the next 30 days so that we can start leveraging those ASAP

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@achingbrain
 - no update, will be released in v0.38.0

#### Gossipsub (js-libp2p)
@vasco-santos

- Initiative finished, `js-ipfs` PR was merged as well as interop tests. will be released in v0.38.0

- We can now configure in the config what router to use. Gossipsub is enabled by default.

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- No update

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold while js-libp2p async/refactor work gets finished

#### IPNS (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

- IPNS over PubSub
  - [libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery#184](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/184) reworked pubsub interfaces to handle topic registration separately from publish/subscribe
  - pubsub tests seem to have issues with leaked goroutines, trying to track them down when I run into them (e.g. https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/pull/138)
  
Adin out next week for ICN conference

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

- No update

#### Package Managers Updates
@dirkmc / @adin / @djdv

- @dirkmc has been putting a lot of effort on the Bitswap side of things, it's been going well
- Working on allowing people to be able to sync these via mounts

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc / @stebalien

- No updates

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@alanshaw

- libp2p-tcp refactor released [v0.14.0](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-tcp/releases/tag/v0.14.0)
- interface-stream-muxer refactor released [v0.7.0](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-stream-muxer/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

  - interface-connection should be completed this week [interface-connection#29](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-connection/pull/29)
  - The new libp2p Switch dial flow should be finished up this week.
    - We will be created some contributor guides to enable contibutors to be able to help with migrations of other modules to async iterator streams
  - Get remaining transports finished
    
*Note*: js-libp2p has a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ibz3Ub0a/js-libp2p-async-refactor) for the refactor effort if you are interested in a more organized breakdown of the remaining tasks. We'll be adding to/ updating it as we unblock / finish items.

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- UnixFSv1.5 - @stebalien
  - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/217
  - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/220
  - If you are interested add you name!
    - @djdv
    - @aschmahmann
    - @achingbrain

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- None

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- Is there documentation on the containerization of images we test?
  - Hasn't been really discussed yet.
  - It would be nice to be able to bake some images to mimic our gateways and eventually pull the images from the testbed so we have a known, well tested, working build/image.

### Parking Lot

- None

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
